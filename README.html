<h1>Evolution of this Website</h1>
<p>Observing professors’ webpage with their research excitements, fascinated me to make one. They looked very streamlined and straight forward yet elegant. Being a Linux and programming enthusiast, I started from scratch to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">learn HTML</a>, wrote this website as my first project and hosted it on <a href="https://github.com/albertshaji/albertshaji.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Since I didn’t have any research articles to share, I decided to use it as a way to do research. Sharing hypothesis/problems/progress here and use StackExchange to discuss and collaborate. <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Terence Tao’s</a> Way of research!</p>
<p>Initially, I also wished to post educational articles, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGFPry6eL0g" target="_blank">John Fish’s</a> YouTube channel excited me to share real-life lessons instead. Narrating failed and successful choices of life is an enriching practice. Honoring the ideas and incidents that shaped my life.</p>
<p>An accidental encounter with <a href="https://fernandobasso.dev/about.html" target="_blank">Fernando Basso’s</a> webpage inspired me to post my story, instead of résumé content. Reading his story was a delightful experience. I also thank him for the minimalist design ideas.</p>
<p>I write the contents in markdown format and then produce the HTML file using <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html" target="_blank">Pandoc</a> via the template file carrying website’s structure.</p>
