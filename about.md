Fishing, fish and water was my love in childhood. My younger cousin and I were crazy about it. But I could only enjoy it during the summer holidays, that's when I visit my hometown. The drawing was my other love. My sister and I use to make lots of drawings as a hobby and also to compete with each other.

Then came a serious love and it was not that quick, I had a hard time understanding the mysterious unknown variable x in algebra. I found that math was the only subject which followed a definite rule, the rules of integer operations made me think so. Other subjects were hard for me to read and understand.

Science appeared interesting facts for me, but many times I was not convinced and asked many why? Questions, Some of them surprised my teachers, while others fetched me little scoldings. Somehow I continued having them no matter what. High schools days, during atomic theory class, Some fundamental questions really triggered my interest to go deep, I tried imagining electrons/protons and how they exchange imaginary entities to hold each other, I enjoyed explaining all sought crazy phenomena with this exchange theory. I Scribbled these ideas down on little paper clips and continue to explore to this date.

Computers were my next love, I could sit down hours and days editing family trip photos in Photoshop, all at once as I had only occasional chance to use the laptop. A few years later I got ThinkPad T61, C++ programming was the only course in my high school that I wished to attend.

Then I moved away from my family to the college campus, There two of my best friends influenced me to explore the mind and helped me to grow spiritually. There I spend a major amount of my time with Linux, minimalist programs and bash scripts.

During each summer break, luckily I got the opportunity to visit premier research institutes and carry out project, this enabled me to discover my true love for math with which I still hold on. Even this [website evolved](README.html) from there.
