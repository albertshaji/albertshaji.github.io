title: Evolution of this Website
---

Observing professors' webpage with their research excitements, fascinated me to make one. They looked very streamlined and straight forward yet elegant. Being a Linux and programming enthusiast, I started from scratch to [learn HTML](https://www.w3schools.com){target="_blank"}, wrote this website as my first project and hosted it on [GitHub](https://github.com/albertshaji/albertshaji.github.io){target="_blank"}. Since I didn't have any research articles to share, I decided to use it as a way to do research. Sharing hypothesis/problems/progress here and use StackExchange to discuss and collaborate. [Terence Tao's](https://terrytao.wordpress.com){target="_blank"} Way of research!

Initially, I also wished to post educational articles, but [John Fish's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGFPry6eL0g){target="_blank"} YouTube channel excited me to share real-life lessons instead. Narrating failed and successful choices of life is an enriching practice. Honoring the ideas and incidents that shaped my life.

An accidental encounter with [Fernando Basso's](https://fernandobasso.dev/about.html){target="_blank"} webpage inspired me to post my story, instead of résumé content. Reading his story was a delightful experience. I also thank him for the minimalist design ideas.

I write the contents in markdown format and then produce the HTML file using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html){target="_blank"} via the template file carrying website's structure.
