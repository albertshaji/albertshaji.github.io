<h1>Evolution of this Website</h1>
<p>Observing professors’ webpage with their research excitements, fascinated me to make one. They looked very streamlined and straight forward yet elegant. Being a Linux and programming enthusiast, I started from scratch to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">learn HTML</a>, wrote this website as my first project and hosted it on <a href="https://github.com/albertshaji/albertshaji.github.io">GitHub</a>. Since I didn’t have any research articles to share, I decided to use it as a way to do research. Sharing hypothesis/problems/progress here and use StackExchange to discuss and collaborate. I would also like to practice the art of re-framing questions to simpler ones and encouraging many to participate. <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com">Terence Tao’s</a> website is my motivation!</p>
<p>Initially, I also wished to post educational articles, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGFPry6eL0g">John Fish’s</a> YouTube channel excited me to share real-life lessons instead. Honoring the ideas and incidents that shaped my life.</p>
<p>An accidental encounter with <a href="https://fernandobasso.dev/about.html">Fernando Basso’s</a> webpage inspired me to post my story, instead of résumé content. Reading his story was a delightful experience. I also thank him for the minimalist design ideas.</p>
<p>I write the contents in markdown format and then produce the HTML file using <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html">Pandoc</a> via the template file carrying the website’s structure. The math symbols and equations are written in LaTeX. They are rendered in HTML via <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#math-rendering-in-html">Mathjax</a>.</p>
