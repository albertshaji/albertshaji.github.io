The long efforts to create a disciplined habit in life taught me something cool. I kept on developing plans which kept on failing on implementation. Which made me very sad :( I simplified it with a monk's perspective, also being influenced by my Linux hobby.

This bought me to Bruce Lipton's biology of belief. A fascinating lecture that helped know how habits are rooted in the subconscious mind. Knowing how habits are different from the conscious decisions transformed many things.

The power of Now by Eckhart Tolle helped to go beyond the mind to consciousness. The experience of reading this masterpiece is hard to put down in words. His teachings dissolved most of my worries. From there picked up a small practice of listing things on a paper and practicing one by one without worry. This also helps you prioritize naturally.

Implementing new programming ideas immediately as conceived, often lead to waste of efforts, because I would later realize new changes are not worth having. This lesson also applies to my life, when looking at pending commitments. Now, when a crazy idea comes I would list it and give it some time to mature and plan how to do it.
