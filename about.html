<p>Fishing, fish and water was my love in childhood. My younger cousin and I were crazy about it. But I could only enjoy it during the summer holidays, that’s when I visited my hometown. Drawing and painting was my other love. My sister and I use to make lots of drawings as a hobby and also to compete with each other.</p>
<p>Then came a serious love and it was not that quick, I had a hard time understanding the mysterious unknown variable x in algebra. I found that math was the only subject that followed a definite rule. The rules of integer operations got me to think that way. Other subjects always felt like they were beyond my comprehension and hard to make sense!</p>
<p>Science bombarded me with fascinating facts, but oftentimes I was not all convinced and asked many Whys and Hows. Some of them surprised my teachers, while others fetched me little trouble. Somehow I continued having them no matter what. High school days, during atomic theory class, some crucial questions really triggered my curiosity to go deep, I tried visualizing electrons and protons exchanging imaginary entities to hold each other, I enjoyed explaining all sorts of crazy phenomena with this exchange idea. I Scribbled these thoughts down on little paper clips and continue to explore to this date.</p>
<p>Computers were my next love, I could sit down hours and days editing family trip photos in Photoshop all at once because access to my uncle’s laptop was occasional, mostly summer holidays. A few years later I got ThinkPad T61, C++ programming was the only course in my high school that I wished to attend.</p>
<p>Then I moved away from my family to the college campus, There two of my best friends influenced me to explore the mind and encouraged me to grow spiritually. There I spend a significant amount of my time with Linux, minimalist programs and bash scripts. <!-- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/albertshaji/x). --></p>
<p>Fortunately each summer vacation, I got the opportunity to visit premier research institutes and carry out projects. This enabled me to discover my true love for mathematics, which I still hold on.</p>
